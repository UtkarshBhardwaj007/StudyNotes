# 1. Cryptography
## 1.1 Kerckhoffs' Principle:
A cryptographic system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.

# 2. Hashing & Encryption
## 2.1 Hashing attacks
* **Preimage Attack**: Given a hash value h, find any message m such that `hash(m) = h`. Trying to find an input that produces a specific target hash
* **Weak Collision Attack (Second Preimage Attack)**: Given a message `m1`, find another message `m2` such that `hash(m1) = hash(m2)`.
* **Strong Collision Attack**: Find any two different messages `m1` and `m2` such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Can use any two inputs, not tied to a specific input or hash.

## 2.2 Encryption
* Symmetric key encryption is less computationally expensive, so faster, than asymmetric key encryption. 
* So we try to share the symmetric keys securely and then use them for communication. 2 ways to share keys:
    * **Diffie Hellman key exchange**: Both parties involved create unique secret keys. Then they share a common `base` and `modulus` and use modular arithmetic to calculate a shared secret key.
    * **Asymmetric Key Encryption (RSA)**: Here both parties create separate public and private keys. The public key is shared with the other party and the private key is kept secret. Both parties use this secure channel to share a symmetric key.
